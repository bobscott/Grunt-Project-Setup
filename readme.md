# Grunt Project Setup

This the Grunt setup that I use on many of my web projects.  

Make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/README.html) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/installing-grunt) installed on your machine.

Add these files to your project and run "npm install" in your project folder to install your grunt modules.
